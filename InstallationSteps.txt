Chaarmi Worlds Installation
===========================
Email: contact@chaarmi.com
Website: www.Chaarmi.com
If you want our team to setup the system our setup fee is $300 USD and takes between 1-2 hours.
Please visit our website or email us to book an appointment and we would be happy to set you up.

BEFORE INSTALLATION STEPS (Once You Have An IP):
1. Obtain the IP of your new server that you will be using
2. Go to your Domain Name Provider
3. Add a new "A" record called metaverse and point it at the IP address
4. Wait up to 24 hours (Depending on the host) for your metaverse galaxy to recognize your new subdomain as follows:
https://metaverse.YOUR_DOMAIN.EXT
5. Setup a new SSL for your new metaverse URL name using any SSL system you wish

INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. Please make sure you have setup a web server with the following =>
	-A SUBDOMAIN on an SSL HTTPS connection with the term metaverse:
	https://metaverse.YOUR_DOMAIN.EXT
	-PHP
	-MySQL (Obtain the credentials => Username, Password, main DB Name)
	-PHPMyAdmin
2. Locate your HTTP or Web folder, make sure it is empty and copy all the files in the MainWebFolder to that folder
3. Outside your HTTP or Web folder copy over the SendGrid folder and make sure it is named SendGrid
4. Also Outside your HTTP or Web folder please create a folder named db_connect_info
5. Run the install.php script and follow the instructions
6. Upon completion a new db.ini file will be created. Copy this file into your db_connect_info folder
7. Test the installation and make sure everything is running by visiting https://metaverse.YOUR_DOMAIN.EXT
8. Delete the install.php file
9. Once you get everything setup you should be able to visit https://metaverse.YOUR_DOMAIN.EXT and have a working experience base. Now go to the
next part and create your first plot of land!

CREATE YOUR FIRST PLOT OF LAND - THE GENESIS PLOT:
1. Visit https://metaverse.YOUR_DOMAIN.EXT/my-admin/
2. Login with the new admin user you created
3. In the view you should see your metaverse stats and at the top menu select Plots
4. Enter the plot name => genesis (all in lowercase)
5. On the left side you should see your new plot, click on it and let Chaarmi Worlds load
6. Design your plot of land by simply grabbing objects from the list and throwing them in. Hit save!
7. Now test out your land by visiting https://metaverse.YOUR_DOMAIN.EXT (This will always load the genesis plot as genesis is a specific key in the system)
8. To load ADDITIONAL plots directly you can use the following format => https://metaverse.chaarmi.com/index.php?plot_id=YOUR_PLOT_ID

2. Go to your webserver and delete ALL files in the main site only (Refere to MainWebFolder to see what files you will be replacing)
